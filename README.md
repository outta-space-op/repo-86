# Programmatic Navigation Code-Along

## Learning Goals

- Explain the use cases for programmatic navigation.
- Use the `useNavigate` hook to perform programmatic navigation.
- Use the `<Navigate>` component to perform programmatic navigation.

## Introduction

So far, we've used a couple components from React Router to allow our users to
navigate our React site: the `NavLink` and `Link` components. However, it would
also be useful to direct our users to another page **without** them needing to
click a link. For example:

- After logging in to the website, direct our user to the home page
- After logging out of the website, direct our user to the login page
- After creating a new item by filling out a form, direct our user to the detail
  page for that item

All of these actions require us to use **programmatic navigation** to change the
browser URL, and show the user a new page in our application, **without** making
the user click on a link.

We've included some files for you to code along in as we walk through the
examples below. The files already have routing set up â€” we just need to update
them to include programmatic navigation!

## The `useNavigate` Hook

To enable programmatic navigation, we can use another custom hook from React
Router: the `useNavigate` hook. Using it in our application is pretty
straightforward:

- First, we import it into the component in which we want to use it; in this
case, we'll be importing into our `App` component: `import { useNavigate } from
"react-router-dom";`.

- Next, we need to invoke our `useNavigate` hook within our component and save
the returned function in a variable. Let's call that variable `navigate` for
simplicity: `const navigate = useNavigate()`.

- Then, whenever we want to use programmatic navigation, we'll simply pass the
route we want to navigate our user to as an argument to the `navigate` function.
`navigate("/")`.

Let's update our `App` component to include some programmatic navigation logic,
as well as some state management logic that mocks user authentication:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
// Add useNavigate to import
import { Outlet, useNavigate} from "react-router-dom";
import NavBar from "./components/NavBar";

function App() {
    // Add code to mock user authentication
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const login = () =>{
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
  }

  const logout = () =>{
    setIsLoggedIn(false);
  };

    // Add programmatic navigation for login and logout
  useEffect(() =>{
    if (isLoggedIn) {
        // navigates to Home route if user is logged in
      navigate("/");
    } else {
        // navigates to Login route if user is logged out
      navigate("/login");
    };
  }, [isLoggedIn]);

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <NavBar logout={logout} />
        { /*Pass login function to Outlet as context */}
      <Outlet context={login}/>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

>**Note:** We placed our call to `navigate` within our `useEffect` because we
>want to navigate our user _after_ they've successfully logged in or out. By
>placing the state that dictates whether or not a user is logged in or out
>within the dependency array of our `useEffect`, we can programmatically
>navigate our user whenever a change in state occurs. This approach means we
>only call `navigate` once our state has updated. You don't always have to put
>`navigate` inside of a `useEffect`, but it makes sense to do so in this case.

Now, we can update our `NavBar` component to handle user logout functionality.

```jsx
// NavBar.js
import { NavLink} from "react-router-dom";
import "./NavBar.css"
function NavBar({ logout }) {

  return (
    <nav>
      <NavLink
        to="/"
        className="nav-link" 
      >
        Home
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink
        to="/about"
        className="nav-link"
      >
        About
      </NavLink>
      {/* Add the logout function to handle the onClick event */}
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default NavBar;
```

And we can update our `Login` component to handle user login.

```jsx
// Login.js
import { useState } from "react";
import { useOutletContext } from "react-router-dom";

function Login() {
  // Access the login function passed as context
  const login = useOutletContext();
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    username: "",
    password: "",
  });

  function handleChange(e) {
    setFormData({
      ...formData,
      [e.target.name]: e.target.value,
    });
  };

  // Create a function that calls the login function when the form is submitted
  function handleLogin(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    login();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <div>
        <input
          id="username"
          type="text"
          name="username"
          value={formData.username}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <div>
        <input
          id="password"
          type="password"
          name="password"
          value={formData.password}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />      
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </form>
  );
};

export default Login;
```

## The Navigate Component

In addition to the `useNavigate` hook, React Router also provides a special
component for redirecting users to a new location: the `Navigate` component.

To use the `Navigate` component, we simply invoke it the same way we would
invoke any other component, then pass it a `to` prop that points toward a route
endpoint: `<Navigate to="/login" />`.

This component is particularly useful in cases where you need to handle some
conditional rendering. For example, in the App component below, instead of
rendering our `NavBar` component we can render a `Navigate` component that will
navigate to the `/login` endpoint if the user is not logged in:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState, useEffect} from "react";
import { Outlet, Navigate, useNavigate} from "react-router-dom";
import NavBar from "./components/NavBar";

function App() {
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);
  const navigate = useNavigate();


   const login = () =>{
    setIsLoggedIn(true);
  };

  const logout = () =>{
    setIsLoggedIn(false);
  };

  useEffect(() =>{
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      navigate("/");
    } else {
      navigate("/login");
    }
  }, [isLoggedIn]);

  return (
    <div className="app">
{/* Add conditional rendering so users have to be logged in to see pages on the site */}
      {isLoggedIn ? <NavBar logout={logout}  /> : <Navigate to="/login" />}
      <Outlet context={login}/>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This means that any user who visits our app and is not logged in will only see
the login page, and won't be able to use the `NavBar` to navigate to other parts
of our website.

## Conclusion

React Router gives us full control over how to navigate users around our
website. In general, the preferred approach is to use the `<Link>` and
`<NavLink>` components to let users perform navigation by clicking links.

However, there are certain scenarios when we want to navigate a user to a new
page after they perform some other type of action, like submitting a form or
logging out. React Router provides two tools to help us with these scenarios:
the `useNavigate` hook and the `<Navigate>` component.
